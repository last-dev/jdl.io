I"ú<p>D. Keith Robinson, Product Designer for Heroku, wrote a blog post around the subject of complaining. It made me do some self reflecting. Iâ€™d like to share the first two points of it with you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Complaining is lame. I do it much more than Iâ€™m comfortable with, you do it, people you want to like do it. We can be better. Hereâ€™s how:</p>

  <p><b>One.</b> Ask, â€œwould my dad complain about this?â€ (Feel free to replace â€œdadâ€ with anyone else you look up to. I use my dad because my dad was awesome.) If not, STFU and move on.</p>

  <p><b>Two.</b> Ask yourself, â€œwill my complaining do anyone (including myself) any good?â€ Most likely the answer is no. Zip it. Go meditate, exercise, eat a Twinkie, etc.</p>
