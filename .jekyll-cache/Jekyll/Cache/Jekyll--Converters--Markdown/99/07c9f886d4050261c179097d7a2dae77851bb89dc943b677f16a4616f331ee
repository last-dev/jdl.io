I"ˆ<p>67 years ago today, on September 9th, 1947, Computer Engineers working on the Mark II computer at Harvard University found a moth stuck in one of the components. They taped the insect in their logbook and labeled it, â€œfirst actual case of bug being found.â€ Iâ€™m sure folks have been calling small flaws in machines â€œbugsâ€ much longer than 66 years, but as the label describes, could this of been the first <em>literal</em> bug found in a computer?</p>

<p>The log book now resides at the National Museum of American History, but apparently is not currently on public view â€“ which seems a shame.</p>
