I think we all are guilty of day-dreaming about life in the future. Sometimes I ponder what kind of home I would want in perfect world. I’d love to have a modern—minimalist styled home. 

I tend to dream of a large loft styled home. I’ve never been attracted to the big mansions. What do I need 10 bathrooms for? Although, when I was looking through local real estate, I stumbled upon a dope modern home in Washington, DC. I more than likely wouldn’t want a house of this size but if my future wife just had to have it, I’d give in. I thought it was so nice, I had to share photos of it:

This home is listed for $4,495,000! Wooh! The price incorporates the level of craftsmanship, the quality of materials, and the careful design.
